# Static-Comp MOD2

## Project Overview
This solo project ended up being much trickier than expected! The goal of the challenge was to recreate a [comp design](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-1/m1-static-comp) given to us and have it be fully responsive by writing HTML and by using flex box, grid, and media queries in the CSS styling. The demo comp was given to us as a desktop layout. We were challenged to have the page layout be responsive to smaller screens such as Iphones, Ipads, tablets, and smaller monitors. We were advised to respect the integrity of the comp by keeping the layout the same, but were given creative freedom for changing up fonts, colors, and images.
